# Overview

Code for researching heuristic search algorithms.

You can build with either GCC or clang.  If one or the other doesn't
work then it is a bug so please tell me.

Ubuntu package dependencies:
	libboost-dev

The plat2d/watch binary and graphics code also need:
	libsdl1.2-dev libsdl-image1.2-dev

search/learnh/lms needs lapack:
	liblapack-dev

Clang versions less than 3.0 do not seem to work.

# Domains

## blocksworld

A bespoke implementation of the [classic planning domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocks_world).

### Instance Generation

Done via python script.
```
python3 problemGen.py -b 10 -ss 3 -sg 5 -f demo_problem.txt
```

### Invoking Solvers

```
cat demo_problem.txt | ./20bw_solver astar
cat demo_problem.txt | ./20bw_solver wastar -wt 2.25
```

## drobot

A domain-specific implementation of dock-worker robots, a classic planning domain.

### Instance Generation

**Not Provided**

### Invoking Solver

```
cat demo_problem.txt | ./drobot_solver astar
cat demo_problem.txt | ./drobot_solver wastar -wt 2.25
```
